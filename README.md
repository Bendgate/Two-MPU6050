# Two-MPU6050
This repo aims to program an arduino sketch that allows the user to control two MPU6050 sensors.<br/>

This sketch is based on Jeff Rowberg's I2C dev lib linked [here](https://github.com/jrowberg/i2cdevlib).<br/>

Before running the arduino sketch, please download the "MPU6050_6Axis_MotionApps20" and "I2Cdev.h" libraries from the link above.
