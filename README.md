# Two-MPU6050
This repo aims to program an arduino sketch that allows the user to control two MPU6050 sensors.<br/>

This sketch is based on Jeff Rowberg's MPU6050 DMP sketch linked [here](https://github.com/jrowberg/i2cdevlib/blob/master/Arduino/MPU6050/examples/MPU6050_DMP6/MPU6050_DMP6.ino).<br/>

Before running the arduino sketch, please download the "MPU6050_6Axis_MotionApps20.h" and "I2Cdev.h" libraries from the link above.
